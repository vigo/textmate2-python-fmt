## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you find any security
vulnerability in our TextMate bundle, please report it by emailing us directly
at [ugurozyilmazel@gmail.com]. Please do not disclose these issues publicly
until we have had a chance to address them.

Thank you for helping keep this project safe and secure.
